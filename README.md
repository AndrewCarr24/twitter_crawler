# twittercrawler
The twittercrawler R package provides a way to collect network friend data through Twitter's standard v1.1 APIs.  To use this package, you will need API credentials.  You can apply for these through Twitter's developer pages (https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/guide).
